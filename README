Problem statement:- 


"Dear audience,
I'd like to address a common challenge faced by many of us as we embark on our journeys into adulthood - the need to leave our
hometowns to pursue educational or career opportunities in new cities.
Let's begin with Case 1, the scenario of a college student:
Imagine you're starting college in a new city, most likely a bustling metropolis. Your first challenge is finding suitable
accommodation, especially if a hostel isn't available. After the arduous task of securing a place to stay, you're confronted with the
need to acquire essential items for your daily life. These items range from a simple bed to sleep on, to a comprehensive set of
kitchen utensils, a refrigerator, a table, chairs, a washing machine, and even basic necessities like Wi-Fi, a bucket, a mug, and a
dustbin etc. This extensive list of essentials can be overwhelming for someone who has just moved far from home, and we'll refer
to this individual as a 'Junior.'
The process of procuring these items demands a significant amount of money, effort, and time, adding to the already stressful
experience of settling into a new city.
The same challenges apply to Case 2, where individuals relocate for job opportunities. They, too, face the daunting task of finding
accommodation and obtaining essential resources.
This is where our platform comes into play, offering a seamless solution to alleviate these challenges and make the transition
smoother."


Proposed solution : 

AnythingNearYou
Now Here come the Solution which will fulfill the gap for which we need to introduce a new character of our story a Senior
Senior : A Senior is someone who is playing the same role as you are going to play now either in your office or in your college but
the import part about the senior is that he no longer require to live in the same city either he completed the college(in case of
college) or he quitting/switching his current job (case2).
So now the senior will have the things which a junior needed or he will need it in upcoming future and believe me there are
enormous number things present for both cases in college or in job.The senior will have the almost everything a junior need or will
need in the further from career advice to flat he used to live in his college or office days.
And senior also looking for a junior or anyone who can buy the resource at any reasonable price because it will be very difficult and
costly for him/her to take all resource with him because some of them are not even useful for him/her anymore and some of
resources are too heavy or big to take with yourself on a long journey
Solution: So solution is I am going to create a platform(AnythingNearYou) on which both senior and junior can register
themselves and a junior can upload the information about the resource he requires and a senior can share the resource which he
no longer needed.Now on the platform junior can search the resource and senior who have it and he can also directly message to
the senior for the resource and buy it.
Tada! Problem Solved.
